# Case Study: Bellabeat

## BACKGROUND
Bellabeat, a 2013-founded high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products wants to analyze the usage of one of its products in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, the company’s executives would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy. The stakeholders believe that analyzing smart device fitness can help unlock new growth opportunities for the company; thus becoming a larger player in the global smart device market.

## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESSES
### PHASE 1: ASK
1. Identify the business task:
Bellabeat wants to run an analysis on how consumers are already using smart devices to provide a data-driven marketing strategy that will contribute to the company’s growth.
2. Consider key stakeholders:
The stakeholders are Urška Sršen (Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer),  Sando Mur (Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder), as well as other team members of the marketing analytics team. 
3. The business task:
The business task is defined as identifying user patterns and trends of usage of their smart devices in order to gain insights that would later better orientate marketing decisions at Bellabeat. Guiding questions to answer include: *What are some trends in smart device usage?
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?*

### PHASE 2: PREPARE
The data used in this analysis is the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data made available by Mobius stored on Kaggle (last updated 2 years ago). The data contains personal fitness tracker from 30 fitbit users. Thirty Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. 

* ROCCC Analysis
  * Reliability : LOW – dataset was collected from 30 individuals whose gender is unknown.
  * Originality : LOW – third party data collect using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
  * Comprehensive : MEDIUM – dataset contains multiple observations on daily activity intensity, calories used, daily steps taken, daily sleep time and weight record.
  * Current : MEDIUM – data is more than six years old, but people's habits tend to not vary a great quantity over a few years
  * Cited : HIGH – data collector and source is well documented

**Data Selection** - Since our focus is pattern recognition with the Fitbit tracker data, the analysis will be conducted using only the most comprehensive datasets: 
```
dailyActivity.csv
dailyCalories.csv
dailyIntensities.csv
dailySteps.csv
sleepDay.csv
weightLogInfo.csv
```

#### PHASE 3: PROCESS
To clean some data, Google Sheets was used, while SQL queries were un on Google Google BigQuery. For visualization purposes, Tableau will be the tool of choice.

**Data Cleaning** 

There is some visible dissonance in the date formats for the sleepDay.csv and the weightLogInfo.csv files, so I decided to update the "SleepDay" and 'Date' fields, respectively, so they both share the same format. This will then allow us to conduct our analysis and observe a potential relationship among variables. The following occured: 
1) Selected the 'SleepDay' and 'Date' columns and formatted them to 'Date' using the spreadsheet function.
2) Doing so removed the time which in this analysis is irrelevant

**Data Integrity** 

First, all the necessary data is loaded for analaysis on Google BigQuery. To identify the number of unique Ids for each table, I run the following query:

```
-- Will yield unique IDs for each tbale
SELECT DISTINCT Id FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.dailyActivity`;
SELECT DISTINCT Id FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.dailyCalories`;
SELECT DISTINCT Id FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.dailyIntensities`;
SELECT DISTINCT Id FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.dailySteps`;
SELECT DISTINCT Id FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.sleepDay`;
SELECT DISTINCT Id FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.weightLog`;
```
The results of this query showed that tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 have 33 distinct IDs, while table 5 and 6 have 24 and 8 distinct IDs, correspondingly. These results reveal some early inconsistencies as we expect 30 unique IDs on all tables since the data was collected from 30 Fitbit users. The sleepDay and the weightLog tables have the highest numbers of inconsistency having 6 and 22 inputs missing. 

### PHASE 4: ANALYSIS

Then, we will establish 3 initial hypotheses in hopes of discovering relationships between variables. 
1) There is a relationship between activity level and calories burned
2) There is a relationship between activity level and sleep time
3) There is a relationship between activity level and BMI

Now, it is time to see start our analysis and confirm or reject our hypothesis. We will first observe the relationship between activity level and calories burned. Then, we will check the other two potential relationships.

```
-- Observing relationship between activity level and calories burned
SELECT *
FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.dailyActivity`
WHERE VeryActiveDistance + 
ModeratelyActiveDistance + LightActiveDistance <> 0 AND VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes <> 0
ORDER BY TotalSteps DESC
 ```
 
 ```
 -- Observing relationship between activity level and sleep time
 SELECT activity.Id, 
ActivityDate,
Calories, 
TotalSleepRecords, 
TotalMinutesAsleep, 
TotalTimeInBed, 
TotalSteps, 
TotalDistance, 
TrackerDistance, 
LoggedActivitiesDistance, 
(VeryActiveDistance + ModeratelyActiveDistance) AS ActiveDistance, 
(LightActiveDistance+SedentaryActiveDistance) AS non_ActiveDistance, 
(VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes) AS ActiveMinutes, 
(LightlyActiveMinutes+SedentaryMinutes) AS non_ActiveMinutes
FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.dailyActivity` AS activity
INNER JOIN `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.sleepDay` AS sleep
ON activity.Id = sleep.Id AND activity.ActivityDate = sleep.Date
 ```
 
 ```
 -- Observing relationship between activity level and BMI
SELECT activity.Id, 
Calories, 
BMI, 
TotalSteps, 
TotalDistance, 
TrackerDistance, 
LoggedActivitiesDistance, 
VeryActiveDistance, 
ModeratelyActiveDistance, 
LightActiveDistance,
SedentaryActiveDistance, 
(VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes) AS ActiveMinutes,
SedentaryMinutes AS NonactiveMinutes
FROM `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.dailyActivity` AS activity
INNER JOIN `bellabeatcasestudy-379900.Bellabeat.weightLog` AS weight
ON activity.Id = weight.Id AND activity.ActivityDate = weight.Date
```
*Note: Decided to choose BMI as the metric to analyze with activity level because BMI accounts for both height and weight, as opposed to only factoring in the weight of an individual. What if a person weights more than their 'ideal weight' but they have a higher percentage of muscles than average people? Would BMI still be an accurate measure?*

### PHASE 5: SHARE THROUGH VISUALIZATIONS

#### Visualization 1: Relationship Between Calories and Activity Level
![calories vs  activity level viz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106201440/224438669-0be62dfb-fa33-45f9-ac7b-dcd4b68e192d.png)

Based on the scatter plot above, the more active a person is, the more calories such individual will burn. Likewise, the amount of calories will decrease as the person becomes more sedentary. 


#### Visualization 2: Relationship Between Sleep Time and Non-active Minutes
![minutes asleep vs  nonactive minutes viz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106201440/224438712-1077fcf4-7854-4eb3-985b-9adbf25fcfed.png)

The visualization above is observing the interaction between total minutes asleep and non-active minutes. We can conclude that the more time a person spent non-active, the less amount of minutes they were able to sleep. Sleep time and non-activity have a negative relationship which implies that when one variable increases, the other one decreases. Although we cannot predict a cause and effect or a correlation due to lack of analysis about sleep quality, this information invites us to think  about sleep quality and not just sleep quantity. *Could there a be relationship between quality of sleep and activity level?* Further research is needed.

#### Visualization 3: Relationship Between Non-active Minutes and BMI
![active nonactiev minutes vs  BMI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106201440/224438720-53d5edfd-9d55-4227-b819-a36fbe40d097.png)

These two charts allow us to compare active and non-active minutes versus the users' BMI. As previously hypothesized, we can observe a relationship between activity levels and BMI. The more minutes of non-activity, the higher the BMI will be; while the more active an individual is, the lower his or her BMI will be.

### CONCLUSIONS

Considering the analysis conducted, it is no secret that physical activity enhances people's lives. The three specifc relationships found during the analyis included: 
1) Very-active minutes yielded a higher amount of calories burned. The more active, the more calories burned, and vice versa.
2) Although we cannot conclude that higher activity levels result in improved quality of sleep, we can say that the more inactive or sedentary a person becomes, the less amount of sleep they get.  
3) An active person at various levels - very, fairly, lightly - will have a lower BMI than someone who is not active.

### HIGH-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS

All the data utilized to conduct this analysis came from Fitbit users, that just like Bellebeat, offer smart devices that boast distance tracking, calories burned, heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, GPS, and tons of other nifty features. In today's world, where we are only getting more and more digital and where people are constantly on their phones, the concept of the app can truly be taken further. The following data-driven decisions are suggested for the future of the Bellabeat app:  

- Create a functionality within the app that reminds users to move, take a walk, or exercise.
- If they do engage in physical activity, reward them with a point/star system, so they feel drawn to the idea of movement. Accumulated points could serve as discount code for their next purchase.
- Have weekly and monthly challenges: let's say a person works out 3-4 times a week, then such individual gets 'x' amounts of points/stars.
- Every morning, have a notification message that ask them about their sleep quality and quantity so they can rate it and then compare results.
